### Question #1: 
1. Create a directory named `test` and make `test` a git repository.
~$ mkdir ~/git_proj/test
~$ cd ~/git_proj/test
~$ git init

2. Create a file named `a.txt` with the content “Git is good” under test and add `a.txt` to the staging area.
~$ touch a.txt
~$ vi a.txt
~$ git add a.txt

3. Run the command `git status` and check the output.
3. Now commit your changes and check the output of `git status`.
~$ git commit -m "Add a.txt to the staging area"

### Question #2:
1. Create a new directory named `subtest` under `test` repo and add a file `b.txt` into it, the content can be anything.


2. Add some more files, for example `a1.txt`, `a2.txt`, to test repo and then add all of them to the staging area.


3. Run `git status` to make sure you have everything in the staging area and then commit them.
